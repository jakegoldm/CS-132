                What do I listen to?
            </h2>
            <p>
                My favorite genre of music to listen to is punk rock. I enjoy
                songs that are really powerful and intense. I have a wide array
                of subgenres and other music types that can be seen below.

                I really like to discover new music and subgenres. I spend a lot of my time 
                just exploring different playlists and albums I find on Spotify. Nevertheless,
                there are still several artists that I listen to the most. Within the last four
                months, my top artists were:

                    <h3>Keshi</h3>
                    <h4>April, 2023</h4>
                    Keshi is a lofi artist who has a lot of very instrumental
                    and acoustic songs. I saw him perform at the Greek Theater 
                    with some friends. The concert was a great time and he put 
                    on a really great show!

                    <h3>The Offspring</h3>
                    <h4>February, 2023</h4>
                    This was arguably the most I've looked forward to any concert.
                    The Offspring is a rock band that formed in the late 80's and 
                    still tours to this day. I went to see them perform at the 
                    Belasco Theater in Downtown LA and the show was amazing. The 
                    only downside was having to wait in line in the pouring rain
                    for what felt like forever, since we wanted to get there as 
                    early as possible to be close to the stage. The show was amazing 
                    and one of the most fun concerts I've ever been to.

                    <h3>Thy Art is Murder &amp; Kublai Khan</h3>
                    <h4>February, 2023</h4>
                    I didn't know either of these bands super well going into the 
                    show. Both of them are death metal, which I don't typically listen
                    to, but still enjoy from time to time. Kublai Khan put on a really 
                    good opener, but we showed up about halfway through their set and 
                    didn't get to experience all they had to offer. By the time Thy Art 
                    is Murder came on, I managed to make it to the rail, which made the 
                    show even more exciting.

                    <h3>Joyce Manor, PUP, Jeff Rosenstock, &amp; Slaughterhouse</h3>
                    <h4>January, 2023</h4>
                    This was the best concert I've ever been to. All four performances
                    were great and brought a lot of energy to the crowd. The entire 
                    show was a little over four hours, so I was pretty exhausted by 
                    the end. It paid off well, however, as Joyce Manor's set was a lot 
                    of fun to experience live.

                    <h3>Rina Sawayama</h3>
                    <h4>November, 2023</h4>
                    Rina is a great artist and has a lot of versitality. The concert 
                    was a really great time. I hadn't listened to a ton of her music 
                    before going to the concert, but I still found it really enjoyable 
                    and would definitely go to another one of her shows!

                    <h3>Cannibal Corpse</h3>
                    <h4>November, 2023</h4>
                    This was the first metal concert I had ever been to, so I wasn't sure 
                    what to expect going in. It was a good concert and a great introduction
                    into what metal had to offer. I was pretty far back in the crowd for 
                    most of the show, since it was my first time in that type of environment.
