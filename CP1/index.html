                My name is Jake Goldman and I'm a current sophomore at Caltech. 
                I grew up in Warrenton, Virginia and attended Fauquier High 
                School from 2017 through 2021. Throughout my time in high 
                school, I was a member of the swim team and National Honors 
                Society. Since, getting to Caltech, I have continued swimming
                while pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. 
                Although sometimes I find that my studies can be a bit
                exhausting - even when I'm at the pool!

            <p>
                In terms of academics, I have a particular interests in 
                networks and cybersecurity. I aim to pursue a PhD in
                cybersecurity following my undergraduate degree and research
                new methods for designing secure software, particularly those
                that deal with networking.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have a wide variety of interests that I partake in during my 
                <em>very infrequent</em> free time. Some of these include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Listening to music. I have a broad music taste and
                    love discovering new artists and going to concerts. You
                    can find more information on music I enjoy 
                    <a href="music.html"> here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hiking. I am a <em>huge</em> nature enthusiast and love
                    exploring new trails and mountains. Some of my favorite
                    hikes I've done are Old Rag in Shenandoah National 
                    Park, The Devil's Marbleyard in the George Washington 
                    and Jefferson National Forest, and Parker Mesa in
                    Topenga state park.

                    Skiing. I love to go ski at every opportunity I get. 
                    Although I'm not an expert, I enjoy spending time on 
                    the slopes and exploring the mountainside. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Weightlifting. I enjoy hitting the gym and lifting 
                    weights. I like to find new exercises to maximize my 
                    gains and hitting new personal bests whenever I can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Horror Movies. I am a huge horror movie fan and I love
                    discovering new films and series I haven't seen yet.
                    Some of my all-time favorites are Scream, A Nightmare on
                    Elm Street, The Descent, and The Ring.
