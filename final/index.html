        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            JakeOS aims to combine the powers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
            cybersecurity to provide constantly evolving and improving computing 
            system. Our technology brings a new computing system that provides 
            layered encryption in networking, relayed connections, isolated memory, 
            as well as a built-in learning system that identifies vulnerabilities 
            based on your activity and consistently improves itself.
